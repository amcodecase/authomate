## Who Am I?

I'm **Justus M Michelo**, most tech people know me as **Case**, or *"That OS Guy"* because I literally have every operating system you can think of running in my lab at the same time … and yes, I actually do.

I spend my time building practical systems, teaching, and creating tools that make development faster and way more fun.
