# About Me

Hi there! 


I'm Justus M Michelo, most tech people know me as Case, or "That OS Guy" because I literally have every operating system you can think of running in my lab at the same time … and yes, I actually do. I'm a systems developer and backend-heavy full-stack developer from Zambia. I spend my time building practical systems, teaching, and creating tools that make development faster and way more fun.

I am an expert in:

* Systems development
* Computer networks
* Cybersecurity

I love designing systems that actually solve problems, mentoring others, and finding clever ways to stop repeating the same work over and over.

Athomate is my personal playground: a toolkit I use to streamline my workflow and focus on building projects that matter.
