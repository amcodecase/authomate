# Athomate

Athomate is my personal system to stop me from rewriting the same backend work over and over. It exists to help me assemble things I always need so I can focus on building quickly.

> I should not have to rebuild the same features. I should assemble them.

## Why I Made Athomate

I kept repeating the same work in every project, which wastes time and energy. Athomate exists to capture those patterns so I don’t have to redo them.

---

## Principles I Follow

* Keep it simple
* Only include what I need
* Avoid overcomplicating
* Focus on what I actually use

---

## How I Use It

Athomate is purely personal. It helps me:

* Move faster
* Avoid repetitive work
* Stay organized
* Keep my projects consistent

It is my toolbox and set of instructions for myself.

---

## Status

Athomate is experimental and personal. I can change it freely as I learn and work on new projects.

---

## Notes

This is for my own reference and experimentation. No one else needs to use it.
