# Athomate - Technical Overview

Athomate is my personal system for backend development. It's designed to stop me from repeating the same patterns across projects and to help me focus on building real functionality.

## What Athomate Does

* Provides reusable backend building APIS that I always implement.
* Lets me quickly assemble functionality without rewriting the same code.
* Keeps development fast and consistent while avoiding repetitive work.

## How I Use It

* I start a new project and include only what I need.
* Everything follows consistent standards that make my workflow smoother.
* I can improve or fix a pattern once and use it across all my projects.

## Development Philosophy

* Minimalistic: only what I actually need.
* API-first: designed for JSON APIs.
* Modular: each piece works independently.
* Personal: built for me and my workflow.

Athomate is my personal toolkit for building backend systems efficiently and consistently.
